    "#### Problem Background and Description\n",
    "Manhattan , is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City. Manhattan serves as the city's economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and historical birthplace.The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers; as well as several small adjacent islands. Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill, a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland, that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each aligned with the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world, and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters. MEG Company produces cosmetic products, they have some stores in Europe but they also want to built a store in Manhattan. They puts lots of work on their Research and Development projects and eventually improved an eyeshadow palet that has tones of colour on it and they also care about human skin health and regulations about chemicals. Before they release the product to the market; MEG Company's manager decide to allocate this project to me. Manager also want from me to build a system that can help in reccommending new places for their new Cosmetic Shop that will open in Manhattan. This will be a major part of their decision-making process. MEG Company want to position for their new shop in high traffic areas where consumers go restaurants, cafes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria\n",
    "According to information provided by another company that have shops in Manhattan suggests that the best locations to open new Cosmetic Shop stores may not only be where other Cosmetic Shops are located. This data strongly suggests that the best places are in fact areas that are near Italıan Restaurants, Cafés, Coffee Shops and Hotels. The people live in Manhattan are very social people that frequent these place often.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis and recommendations for this new store locations will provide us on general districts with these establishments, not on specific store addresses. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further research to be conducted, or on the ground searching for specific sites by the company's personnel.\n"

    "The number of main districts in Manhattan is 40 . The data regarding the districts in Manhattan needs to be provided for this analyses. Before the exploratory analyses, we can see that the raw data is not a usable form. We need to prepare the data to turn its usable form to do so firstly data wrangling and cleaning will have to be performed.

This results are the best districts to match our criteria.\n",

    "* Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to perform this analysis using a different methodology and maybe even different data source. I worked with clustering algorithms to cluster the data but I see that the results have no accurate endpoint because this is based on the criterias that are chosen by us. On the other hand, this data analysis recommendations helped us to narrow down the possible options and it gave to us a startpoint for the possible exact store points. "
